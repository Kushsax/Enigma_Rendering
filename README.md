# DonateUs ‚Äî Micro-Donation & Impact Tracking Platform

**DonateUs** is a hyper-local micro-donation platform where donors build a ‚Äúdonation portfolio‚Äù (like an investment portfolio). Moderators verify local projects and donors see real-world impact (e.g., kids helped, trees planted). Ideal for small recurring donations, transparent impact tracking, and community-driven projects.
